**Modula Gitlab** is a mashup of **Modula Mojito** and the Gitlab standard theme.

In the spirit of further linking Gitlab and Redmine, I have created this theme.  For details on official integration, see gitlabhq/gitlabhq#97.


**Modula Mojito** (http://github.com/mindclick/modula-mojito) is a great theme for [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) made by [Modula](http://www.modula.fi).

Modula has [not been able to maintain the theme](http://www.modula.fi/2011/something-obsolete-and-something-new/) through to the latest versions of Redmine, so this repository takes the [last published version from Modula](http://www.modula.fi/2009/redmine-theme-modula-mojito/) and adds a few improvements show in the page's comments.

Contributions and improvements via GitHub are most welcome, to be able to maintain compatiblity with the latest versions of Redmine (and now, for [ChiliProject](https://www.chiliproject.org) also).

This theme is free to use and distribute as you wish.  Many thanks to all previous contributors.
